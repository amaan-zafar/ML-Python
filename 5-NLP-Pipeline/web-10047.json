It can extract text, but it has no format:", "pdf form screenshot:", "Code run results:", "\u00a0", "It's not easy to restore this result to a table. Too many rules will inevitably lead to a decline in versatility.", "\u00a0", "Tabulula is designed to extract PDF table data, while supporting PDF export to CSV, Excel format, but this tool is written in java, depending on Java 7/8. tabula-py is a layer of python encapsulation, so it also relies on Java 7/8.", "The code is simple:", "Although it is said to be specialized in processing tables in pdf, the actual effect is not so good. Or the PDF used in pdfminer. The results are as follows:", "This result is really awkward. The header recognition is wrong. There are two tables in the pdf. I don't find how to distinguish the tables.", "\u00a0", "Pdf plus is a page-by-page processing of pdf, which can obtain all the text of the page, and provides a separate method for extracting tables.", "The resulting table is a two-dimensional array of string type, which is shown in line output for comparison with tabula.", "As you can see, compared with tabula, first of all, it can distinguish tables, secondly, the accuracy has been improved a lot, and the recognition of the header is completely correct. For those with line breaks in the table, the recognition is not very correct, but at least the partition of columns is not a problem, so it can be handled.", "After treatment, the operation results are as follows:", "This result is absolutely correct, and with tabula, even after processing, it is impossible to get such a result. Of course, different PDFs may need different processing, but the actual situation still needs to be analyzed by oneself.", "Pdf plus also has inaccurate processing, mainly in the absence of columns:", "I found another pdf. The screenshot of the table is as follows:", "The analytical results are as follows:", "Four columns become two columns. In addition, if the table has merged cells, there will be such a problem. I chose this table to show because it is special, and no merged cells are missing. This should be related to the generation of pdf.", "But in fact, the data is complete, not lost, but is considered to be non-tabular. The output page.extract_text() is as follows:", "\u00a0", "Then I tried it with tabula, and the results are as follows:", "The list is all, but what about the header?", "\u00a0", "Pdfplus also provides a graphics Debug function, which can get the screenshots of PDF pages, and use boxes to identify text or tables to help judge the recognition of PDF, and adjust the configuration. To use this feature, you also need to install Image Magick. Because it was not used, so I did not go into details for the time being.", "\u00a0", "When we do crawler, we will inevitably encounter PDF need to parse, mainly for text and table data extraction. And python has too many libraries to deal with pdf, such as pypdf2, and there are too many materials on the internet, but I tried to read it out as scrambled code, without careful reading of the source code, so this problem has not been solved.", "But after comparing the three libraries commonly used, I think that PDF plus is better to use and the support for tables is the best.", "\n            Posted by ", "gdlwx", "\n                        in ", "Python", "\n                        at ", "Dec 04, 2018 - 12:41 AM", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Java", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 321", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Android", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 221", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Linux", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 182", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Python", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 111", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "MySQL", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 103", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Programming", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 101", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Javascript", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 98", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Database", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 52", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Big Data", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 45", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "Oracle", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 45", "\n                    ", "\n            ", "iOS", "\n                            ", "\u00d7 43", "\n                    ", "\n                ", "Java", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 5747", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Python", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 2242", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Linux", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 1283", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Algorithm", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 1229", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Javascript", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 1227", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Spring", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 1009", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "data structure", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 895", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "C++", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 819", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "MySQL", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 766", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Design Pattern", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 712", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Front-end", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 650", "\n                            ", "\n                ", "Database", "\n                                    ", "\u00d7 641", "\n                            ", "Python,table,IT,this,import,object,processing,can,CODE,test,Java,File,string,list,csv,RE,here,strip,Excel,layer,encapsulation,encoding,index,array,new,debug,function,Configuration,image,Go,crawler,source code", "Pdf is an exceptional pitfall.
